### What is the 8 Week SQL Challenge?

My idea was to create a online community which supports all data professionals who were specifically starting on their SQL learning journey.

I also wanted to help everyone start crafting their own personal branding, online presence and a personal portfolio of data projects - and so the 8 Week SQL Challenge was born!

## For the next 8 weeks - I challenge you to:

Dedicate yourself to learning SQL
Share regular updates on social media about what you are learning
Get started on your own GitHub Pages personal website and project portfolio
How can I get started with the challenge?

Share an update on LinkedIn using the dedicated #8WeekSQLChallenge hashtag
Start solving the 8 Week SQL Challenge case studies
Here’s an example post you could share on LinkedIn - please feel free to improvise and personalise your post as much as you like!



## When does the 8 Week SQL Challenge actually start?

In all honesty, the challenge has no official start or end date!

You can literally start and finish the 8 Week SQL Challenge anytime you like - even the 8 week period is not a mandatory requirement :)

I’m ready to start the challenge - what should I learn first?

There is no one single correct answer for this question but here are a few suggestions!

## What is Serious SQL?

Serious SQL is an online course that I’ve created - it is the very first part of the Data With Danny virtual apprenticeship program.

Serious SQL is priced at $49USD and $29 for students and includes access to all written course content, community events as well as live and recorded SQL training videos!

Here are a few reasons why I think Serious SQL is perfect for anyone starting their data and SQL learning journey - I’ve created this course to help beginners and experienced practitioners alike.

Can I learn SQL directly from Danny?

From November 2021 - I’ve started weekly live SQL training to cover all of the written course content from beginning to end. All live streams are recorded and uploaded to the Serious SQL course player and available for students to watch on demand.

Each weekly session runs for about 90 minutes with an additional 15-30 minutes of live Q&A where I answer a wide variety of questions about data, career, social media and other topics such as health, motivation and productivity, which I am very passionate about!

Live training restarts on the 15th of January 2022 to cover everything from table joins and beyond as we continue with the Marketing Analytics case study section of the Serious SQL course!

Additional Bonus Content
Gain familiarity with popular programming tools such as Docker, Markdown, GitHub and the command line interface (CLI)

Learn how to setup your own GitHub Pages project portfolio page with a guided step-by-step guide

Full access to complete solutions for all case studies included in the 8 Week SQL Challenge with full explanations

Course Setup
All database and SQL interface infrastructure are Docker based and I’ll help you get setup for Docker Desktop on Windows, Mac and Linux systems - Docker is simply a must-have skill if you want to move into data science and machine learning!

Installation and setup of all required data and systems is super fast and will run on all machine types that support Docker Desktop including Windows, Ubuntu and all Macs including the latest generation of Apple M1 Macs.

Dedicated Support
We also have dedicated Q&A threads for each separate course tutorial as well as a dedicated SQL Support Forum where all students enrolled in the course can share their SQL problems for direct assistance - even if its for data or problems that are not included in the course.

Serious SQL is priced at $49USD and $29USD for students - please send an email to support@datawithdanny.com from your educational email or include your enrolment details or student identification for a speedy response!

Will you be providing case study coding solutions?

If you’d like to see the complete code solutions and detailed explanations for all case studies and a whole lot more, please consider joining me for the Serious SQL course - you’ll get access to all course materials, case study solutions and I’m on hand to answer all of your additional SQL questions directly!

Serious SQL students get access to complete solutions for each case study, they will be made available directly inside the Serious SQL course player after the case studies are published here so everyone has a chance to try and solve the problems before solutions are provided.

Complex sections identified by students will also have specific video explanations to cover key problem areas - join me to get customised support and in-depth explanations for the parts which you find most challenging.

I’m nervous about sharing stuff on LinkedIn - what should I do?

I totally understand this as I was in exactly the same position - scared out of my wits and never bringing myself to post anything!

The secret is to start posting regularly and aim to help others with your posts. That was the one single thing that really helped me grow on LinkedIn!

Remember the following tips for LinkedIn posts to maximise your reach:

Avoid sharing direct links in posts as reach is depressed for external and post shares - add the URLs after by editing your original post

Be sure to keep your first 2-3 lines catchy and snappy - you only have a few seconds to capture someone’s attention in this digital world

Sometimes it helps to post an eye-catching picture - we humans process visual information much more efficiently than reading

The initial like:view ratio is the main determinant for your post reach, reshares also help boost overall view counts

Limit your amount of hashtags per post to 3-4 and aim for tags with lots of followers or specific community hashtags (like #8WeekSQLChallenge or #DataWithDanny or #66DaysOfData) - you can check the counts by clicking on the hashtag on LinkedIn (#Data #Analytics #DataScience #BigData are my go to tags for reach!)

Resharing other people’s posts is a good way to help promote their content but will usually generate low view counts for your post, this is normal

Join in the conversation and regularly comment on popular influencers’ posts

You might laugh at that last point - but trust me! This really works because this is pretty much how I became friends with many data superstars like Eric Weber, Ben Taylor and Kate Strachnyi :)
